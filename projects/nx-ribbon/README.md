# NxRibbon

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.0.

## Description

Have you ever been in situation where you have multiple environments open in the same browser? 
Have you ever made a mistake of creating or deleting something from production environment? 
Using this library will help you easily distinguish development from production environment.

Inspiration for this idea came from my dear friend (S.B.). 

Note: If we ever make a billion dollars from it, trust me - half is yours :)
